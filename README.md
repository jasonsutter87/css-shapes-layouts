Non-rectangular Layouts with CSS Shapes and Exclusions.

Demos for my blog post: [Creating Non-Rectangular Layouts with CSS Shapes and Exclusions](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-shapes/)

Demos will only work in browsers that support CSS Shapes and Exclusions. At the time of writing of the article, only Chrome Canary supports CSS Shapes under a flag.

Make sure you enable experimental features in Canary to see the working demos.
